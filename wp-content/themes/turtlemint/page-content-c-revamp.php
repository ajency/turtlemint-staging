						<h2 class="SEO-content-heading">Types of life insurance we offer</h2>
						<div class="SEO-content-text">Life insurance plans are characterized by the fact that they pay a
						benefit on death of the insured. The most popular plans have a fixed period of time for which the
						policy is in force, and death benefit will be paid. Term Life, Endowment, ULIPs, Pension Plans, 
						and Child Plans all have fixed terms. On the other hand, Whole Life Plans offer cover for the entire 
						lifetime. Read on to know more about each of these.<br><br>
						
						
						<p><b>Term Life:</b><br>Term Insurance plans provide a death benefit for a fixed tenure. This is the most 
						basic and also the most important type of life insurance policy available in the market.
						There are certain sub-types of term life plans like level term plans, increasing term plans, 
						decreasing term plans & term plan with return of premium.</p>
						
						<p><b>Endowment plans:</b><br><a class="linkaction" href="https://www.turtlemint.com/life-insurance/endowment-policy/" target="_blank">Endowment plans</a> are savings-oriented life insurance plans. 
						These plans have both death benefit as well as maturity benefit.<br>
						Death Benefit is paid to the nominee if the life insured dies within the policy tenure and Maturity 
						Benefit is paid to the policyholder if he survives the entire policy tenure.</p>
						
						<p><b>ULIPS:</b><br><a class="linkaction" href="https://www.turtlemint.com/life-insurance/ulip-plans/" target="_blank"> Unit Linked insurance plans (ULIPs)</a> are investment oriented insurance plans. 
						Under these plans, the premiums paid are invested in the capital market. There are different types 
						of investment funds and the policyholder can choose the fund in which the premium should be invested. 
						ULIPs allow a fund option to choose from equity, debt, balanced, liquid etc.</p>
						
						<p><b>Child Insurance plans:</b><br><a class="linkaction" href="https://www.turtlemint.com/life-insurance/articles/child-investment-plans-insurance-policies-india/" target="_blank">Child plans</a> are life insurance plans created specifically for 
						providing financial stability to the child. The parent or the child is the life insured under the plan.
						Usually, the parent is covered in a child plan.</p>
						
						<p>There are 2 types of child insurance plans:</p>
						<ol type="1" style="margin-left:32px;">
						<li>One being the traditional child insurance plans with maturity, 
						bonus (if applicable) and death benefit, if the parent dies.</li>
						<li>Unit-linked child plans with maturity (investment premium + growth) and a death benefit 
						if the parent dies</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p><b>Whole life plan::</b><br>Whole Life Plans are unlimited Term Plans. These plans cover individuals till 
						99 or 100 years of age.</p>
						
						<p><b>Pension plans:</b><br>Pension plans are retirement-oriented life insurance plans. 
						Under these plans, the policyholder creates a corpus from which regular annuity payouts are 
						given till the insured is alive. Pension plans come in two variants - Deferred pension plans
						and Immediate annuity plans.</p></div>

							<div class="SEO-content-text">However, before you invest in a life insurance plan, here are 7 things that you absolutely need to know -</div>
							<div class="SEO-content-text">
								<ol>
									<li>
										<b>Insurance is NOT an investment</b><br>This is the first thing you need to acknowledge and accept that insurance should never be considered as an investment. Insurance is a vital part of financial planning. But a lot of people consider it as an investment.<br>
										This is primarily because there are some life insurance plans in India that double up as investments.  For example, Endowment Policies have a lump-sum maturity benefit, Money Back Plans have regular payments during the entire policy tenure as pre-defined schedule and Unit Linked Insurance Plans have an opportunity to choose your investments even in equity! But what you need to keep in mind while choosing your Life Insurance Policy is the coverage amount you wish to purchase for your family. Insurance is synonymous to protection and that is the primary and most important objective of ANY life insurance product. They should not be evaluated on the basis of their return, bonus, etc.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Required Coverage amount</b><br>The required coverage amount for your insurance policy is the most important aspect of choosing a plan. It depends on your lifestyle and priorities. You have to consider your standard of living, inflation, needs, liabilities etc. Then, accordingly, decide your coverage amount which would be sufficient for your family.<br>
										For instance, if your familyâ€™s monthly expenses are say â‚¹50,000. You need to opt for a Life Insurance coverage of at least â‚¹ 1 crore so that a post-tax interest earning is enough to provide for the familyâ€™s regular monthly expenses! So, ensure that your coverage amount is sufficient to meet the monthly expense of your family in your absence.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Policy Tenure</b><br>The tenure of Life insurance policies depends on the type of plan you opt for. You can choose any tenure that you think is necessary for you and your family. However, the best way to select an apt tenure for your insurance policy is as long as you are earning and providing for your family. This is typically till the age of 60 or 65 years post which your children will definitely start earning and so your financial dependence will gradually reduce!
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Type of Life Insurance best suited for you</b><br>There are varieties of plans offered and available in the market. It all depends on your needs as to which plan you opt for. Some of the insurance plans are:
										<ol type="1" style="margin-left:32px;">
											<li>Term Insurance</li>
											<li>Whole life insurance plans</li>
											<li>Endowment Assurance Plans</li>
											<li>Money-Back Plans</li>
											<li>Child Plans</li>
											<li>Pension Plans</li>
											<li>Unit Linked Insurance Plan</li>
										</ol><br>
										Out of the above-stated plans, <a class="linkaction" href="https://www.turtlemint.com/term-life-insurance?utm_source=turtlemint-blog&amp;utm_medium=organic-blog&amp;utm_campaign=Term-Life-Blog">Term Plan</a> is the basic and the purest form of life Insurance. It is the cheapest plan. This plan covers only the death risk and has no maturity benefit. The payment is made in lump-sum amount if the insured person dies during the tenure of the plan.<br>
										Read more about <a class="linkaction" href="https://www.turtlemint.com/term-life-insurance/articles/why-is-term-insurance-an-absolute-buy?utm_source=turtlemint-blog&amp;utm_medium=organic-blog&amp;utm_campaign=Term-Life-Blog">Why is term insurance is an absolute buy</a><br>
										So, if you need a high coverage at a low cost, term plan is the best choice!
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Claim Procedure:</b><br>You and your nominee should be completely aware of the claim procedure so as to expedite the claim as and when the requirement occurs.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Benefit Offered: Death and Maturity Benefit</b><br>There are two types of benefits in life insurance plans.
										<ol type="a" style="margin-left:32px;">
											<li>One is Death Benefit, where the beneficiaries will receive a lump-sum amount if the life insured dies within the policy tenure.</li>
											<li>The other one is Maturity Benefit, where the claim arises when the policy is matured. 
											It is paid only when all premiums are paid on time.<br>Maturity Benefit is payable to all 
											life insurance policies except term plans. Endowment Plans are a type of Life Insurance 
											with maturity benefit. Even ULIPs have maturity benefits. These kinds of policies are 
											relatively quite expensive compared to term insurance, but it protects your family with 
											a coverage amount in case the insured dies within the policy tenure. Alongside, these 
											policies have a maturity benefit payable to the policyholder, if you happen to outlive 
											the entire tenure. Hence, the money is not completely foregone in case you survive past 
											the policy term; as is the case with term plans!</li>
										</ol>
										
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Tax Advantages</b><br>Life Insurance plans, apart from providing funds, also save taxes. Under <a href="https://cleartax.in/s/80c-80-deductions">Section 80C</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Income-tax_Act,_1961">Income Tax Act, 1961</a>, premium amount contributed to life insurance plans are eligible for tax rebate. The limit for premium contribution is up to â‚¹1,50,000. Also, under <a href="http://profit.ndtv.com/news/your-money/article-how-to-avail-tax-benefits-under-section-10-377826">Section 10(10D)</a> of Income Tax Act, 1961, amount of sum insured paid on maturity or death or surrender of policy is completely tax-free. So, life insurance is preferred by many as it protects your family and is also tax efficient.

												Pure protection policies or term life plans: Life insurance term plan pays your family the death benefit as mentioned in the policy in case of your death while the policy is in force.
											</p>
											<p class="paragraph-text paragraph-style">
												In comparison to investment-type life insurance plans, term life plans only get you a death benefit and not any other return.
											</p>
											<p class="paragraph-text paragraph-style">
												Investment policies: Investment-type life insurance plan pays your family a certain sum of money as maturity returns after a set time period (called policy term) or the death benefit in event of your death (while the policy is in force); in exchange of a premium.
											</p>
											<p class="paragraph-text paragraph-style">
												Typically maturity periods are ten, fifteen or twenty years upto a certain age limit, usually 65 years. Furthermore, these policies are traditional with-profits or unit linked (ULIP) plans. The death benefit you get is lesser in comparison to pure protection (term insurance) plans, typically 7 -10 times your annual premium.

											</p>
											<p class="paragraph-text paragraph-style">
												Why would you need so much cover? Consider a simple scenario, where Anil, whoâ€™s salary is 5 lakhs, took the recommended minimum cover of 10 times salary, i.e. 50 lakhs. On his death, his family puts the 50 lakhs of payout corpus in a fixed deposit. With interest of 8% this would give 4 lakhs of substitute income for his family, to manage their day-to-day expenses. Itâ€™s less than before but should be fine since Anilâ€™s expenses are no longer to be borne. Now if Anil had loans to pay or other unplanned costs come up, then the corpus will reduce and so will the interest income. Also with effect of inflation the interest income may not be enough as years pass by. So, to be fully safe ideal cover would be 20 times the salary.
