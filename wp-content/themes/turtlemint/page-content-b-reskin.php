          <h2 class="SEO-content-heading">What is a health insurance policy?</h2>
          <div class="SEO-content-text">Health insurance, also called Mediclaim, is a way to pay for advanced 
            medical treatments that typically require you to be in hospital overnight. It also covers certain 
            other day care procedures like cataract surgery, etc. that don't require you to be hospitalized but
            are expensive nevertheless. A health insurance policy, therefore, covers your medical expenses and
            gives you financial relief.
          </div>
          <h2 class="SEO-content-heading">Why is health insurance policy important &amp; why should you buy it?</h2>
          <div class="SEO-content-text">Medical insurance is a form of insurance which covers the medical costs
            incurred in case of medical emergencies. These plans, thus, take care of the financial burden associated 
            with medical contingencies. In today’s age, when illnesses and diseases are on the rise,
            a health insurance plan becomes necessary. Though medical developments have provided a
            cure for most of the illnesses, such as cures and treatments come at very expensive costs.
            These costs become unbearable for the common middle-class man. A health plan, by covering 
            these costs, takes off the financial strain caused by frequently occurring illnesses. It, therefore,
            proves to be an essential requirement for every individual looking to secure his finances against medical 
            contingencies.
          </div>
          <h2 class="SEO-content-heading">Health insurance calculator</h2>
          <div class="SEO-content-text">A health insurance calculator, also known as a medical premium calculator,
            helps you in calculating the premiums that you need to pay for any certain health insurance policy.
            It is an online tool that is available on insurance marketplaces and health insurance websites. 
            You just need to enter a few details such as your age, general health, profession and insurance needs, 
            as the premium depends on primary factors like the amount of sum assured, number of people covered under 
            the insurance, type of coverage etc. when you fill in the details, you will be shown the amount that you
            would have to pay towards your health insurance premium.<br>
            Before investing in any health insurance plan, it is equally important to calculate the premiums that 
            you will have to pay monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly. This way you will know exactly the amount 
            you need to invest, thus, making a proper financial plan.

          <h2 class="SEO-content-heading">How to buy health insurance online?</h2>
          <div class="SEO-content-text ">
            When investing in a health insurance plan, it is recommended that you 
            first browse through the wide range of policies that are available online. You would like to choose 
            a policy which is hassle free and serves your unique needs. There are a few factors that you should 
            consider while buying an insurance online:-<br>
            <ol type="1">
              <li><b>Check For The Insured Sum</b><br>
                Many companies limit the amount that you can invest in a policy. If you wish to invest a higher sum,
                look for insurance that suits your requirements. Generally, having a cover that is six times of your 
                annual salary is good. If you have plans of starting a family in a few years, don’t forget to explore 
                the maternity coverage option.
              </li>
              <li><b>Check For The Hospitals</b><br>
                Different companies have tie ups with different hospitals. Make sure that your insurer provides cashless
                coverage at the top hospitals in your city. This would make the entire process smooth.
              </li>
              <li><b>Check The Policy Terms</b><br>
                Different plans have different limits and sub-limits. Hence, before making any investment be sure that 
                you have read and completely understood the guidelines. Be very sure regarding how much cost would be 
                covered by your insurance per hospitalization.And what are the pre and post limits of the plan as well.
                Some companies provide 30 day pre and 60 day post hospitalization costs while some companies provide 60 
                and 90 days period.<br>Certain exclusions are included in each and every plan. Make sure you read through
                them carefully. Check for the waiting periods and co-pay. Shorter waiting period and voluntary co-paying
                is ideal.
              </li>
              <li><b>Don’t forget Additional Benefits</b><br>
                Most health insurance companies offer additional benefits with the policies to hold themselves up in 
                the competitive market. The no claim benefits and restoration benefit are the most popular ones.							
                Make sure that the company you are choosing has a good market reputation, is trusted and provides 
                good customer care service 24*7 throughout.

        <h2 class="SEO-content-heading">Factors to consider while deciding the health insurance company and its plan</h2>
        <div class="SEO-content-text">Since medical insurance plans are important in providing financial security, they are quite popular. 
          Almost all general insurance companies in India offer a wide variety of health insurance plans for individuals. 
          Among the hundreds of plans available, it becomes very difficult for individuals to understand which plan would 
          be the best health plan for them. So, here is a guide to choose the <a class="linkaction" href="https://www.turtlemint.com/health-insurance/" target="_blank">best health insurance</a> in India –
        </div>
        <ul style="margin-left:32px;" class="SEO-content-text">
          <li>
            <strong>Understand the type of coverage required</strong> 
            <p> first and foremost, individuals should understand the type of health plan which would suit their needs. If they don’t have any health insurance, a family floater or individual plan is recommended. If there is an existing health plan, a top-up plan is good for enhancing coverage at low health insurance quotes. Critical illness plans are also a must for protection against major illnesses while disease-specific plans are helpful in protecting against specified ailments. Individuals should assess their requirement and choose the most suitable plans for themselves.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ensure that all family members are covered  </strong> 
            <p> health contingencies can strike anyone and so individuals should endeavour to cover all of their family members under health insurance plans.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The sum insured should be optimal </strong>
            <p> the sum insured of the medical insurance plan should be sufficient to pay for the high medical costs which would incur in an emergency.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Look for comprehensive coverage features </strong> 
            <p>the medical insurance plan which provides the most inclusive coverage benefits would be the best health plan. Individuals should look for such comprehensive plans and see if the coverage benefits are relevant to their needs.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The premium rate should be reasonable</strong>
            <p> besides the coverage benefits which should be all-inclusive, the premium of the best health insurance plan should also be reasonable and affordable. If the plan has very high premiums, it would not be the best health insurance plan.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compare before buying</strong> 
            <p>to choose the best health insurance plan in India, the best way is to compare the different plans and then buy one. Comparing lets you see the available plans and helps you in choosing one plan which is the best from the rest.</p>

        <h2 class="SEO-content-heading">Health Insurance claim settlement procedures</h2>
        <div class="SEO-content-text">To make a successful claim in a health insurance policy, policyholders are required to follow the below-mentioned process –</div>

        <ul style="margin-left:32px;" class="SEO-content-text">
          <li>The policyholder should inform the insurance company of the claim. This information is to be given by filling up and submitting a pre-authorisation form. The insurance company analyses the form and approves cashless claim settlements. The form should be submitted at least 4-5 days before a planned hospitalisation. If, on the other hand, the hospitalisation was an emergency, the form should be submitted within 24 hours of hospitalisation</li>
          <li>The health card or the policy bond should be produced to the hospital along with the identity proof of the insured</li>
          <li>The company would then take care of the medical expenses</li>
          <li>All medical documents, reports and bills should be submitted to the insurance company along with the claim form.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="SEO-content-text">In case of reimbursement claims</div>
        <ul style="margin-left:32px;" class="SEO-content-text">
          <li>The insured should get admitted to a non-network hospital and avail the necessary medical treatments. Payment for the treatments would have to be done by the policyholder himself</li>
          <li>Once the insured is discharged from the hospital, the discharge summary or discharge certificate should be collected</li>

        <h2 class="SEO-content-heading">Why  buy A health insurance plan at an early age?</h2>
        <div class="SEO-content-text">
          There are too many reasons to justify the point why an individual must 
          start investing early in his life:-<br>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Comprehensive cover</b><br>
              If you make the wise decision of buying a health insurance plan early in life then you’ll enjoy 
              the benefit of a much more comprehensive coverage. You will get more security and enhanced coverage 
              that would be difficult at a later stage. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Cheaper Premiums</b><br>
              The company charges less premiums from younger individuals as they are expected to be in the pink 
              of health and thus less chance of claim.

            <li><b>Tax benefits for long</b><br>
              Under section 80D of Tax Act 1961, you will enjoy tax exemptions for paying premiums on health insurance. 
              If you purchase it at a younger age, you’ll enjoy the benefit for a longer time.
            </li>
            <li><b>Long tenure of coverage</b><br>
              Taking health insurance at a young age assures more coverage in the longer period of time.
            </li>
            <li><b>Bonus</b><br>
              Most insurances provide a ‘no-claim’ bonus when the policy is renewed and the cover is not availed 
              in the previous year. If you buy the insurance at a young age and keep collecting the no-claim bonuses 
              on policy renewal, it will increase your coverage amount when you’re old and grey.
            </li>
            <li><b>Waiting period</b><br>
              Most coverage features come with a waiting period of 30 days to 4 years, if you invest early in the policy, you may avail 
              the facilities when required instead of stumbling on the waiting period.

        <h2 class="SEO-content-heading">What are the factors that affect health insurance premiums?</h2>
        <div class="SEO-content-text ">
          There are certain <a class="linkaction" href="https://www.turtlemint.com/health-insurance/articles/how-is-the-premium-for-health-insurance-calculated/" target=_blank">major factors</a> that affect the type of coverage you will receive on your insurance. 
          Some of the most important of them are as follows-<br>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Age</b><br>
              The general rule of thumb is, higher the age, higher the premium. It is because older 
              people are more likely to suffer and claim the insurance than young people who are in 
              the pink of their health.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Past Medical History</b><br>
              <p>It highly affects the amount of premium you are going to pay. If you have a pre-medical 
                condition, then the premium charged is higher. However if you are relatively healthy, 
                the premium is less.
            </li>
            <li><b>Occupation</b><br>
              Your occupation highly influences your premium rates. For example, if you are a corporate 
              employee or a teacher, the premium would be less, however, if you work at a construction 
              site or factory, premiums are generally high. This happened due to the degree of risk factor
              that is involved with both kinds of task.
            </li>
            <li><b>Body Mass Index (BMI)</b><br>
              People with a higher BMI are prone to more ailments like heart diseases, type 2 diabetes,
              breathing problems, high blood pressure and cancer than people with lower body mass index.
              Hence the premium is higher for the people with more BMI.
            </li>
            <li><b>Smoking habits</b><br>
              Insurance companies view smokers as high-risk insurance buyers since they are more inclined towards health risks. Therefore,
              smokers are charged more premium in comparison to non-smokers.
            </li>
            <li><b>Geographical Location</b><br>					
              The location where you stay affects your premium cost since certain regions 
              lack proper healthy food options, climate and health facilities.
            </li>
            <li><b>Policy Duration</b><br>
              If you choose a longer term plan, the premium would be less that is why investing earlier in health 
              insurance is always suggested.
            </li>
            <li><b>Co-insurance feature</b><br>
              If you choose the co-insurance feature of the company while purchasing the policy, 
              your premiums reduce to a great extent.

        <h2 class="SEO-content-heading">Some myths about health insurance</h2>
        <div class="SEO-content-text ">
          When it comes to health insurance, there are still many who are not 
          very well versed with its components. Due to lack of information, often myths can arise. Here 
          are some of the most common myths regarding health insurance and its coverage-<br>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <b>Myth: </b>&nbsp; I am young and fit. I don't need health insurance.
              <p><b>Reality </b>&nbsp;
                It is the best time to invest in a health policy while you are young and fit. Companies will charge 
                you a lower percentage of premium and you will receive a greater amount of coverage over a 
                long period of time.<br>Certain diseases do not show early symptoms and by the time they become 
                critical and evident, it becomes too late to invest in a policy and avail the benefits because 
                pre-existing health conditions come with a waiting period of 36 to 48 months generally from the 
                day of buying the policy.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Myth: </b>&nbsp; 24-hour hospitalisation is mandatory for making a claim
              <p><b>Reality </b>
                No, it's not. With the rapid improvement in medical technology, certain surgeries/ 
                daycare procedures get completed within 24 hours and do not require hospitalisation. 
                Such coverage is offered by most companies, yet make sure your policy contains all such benefits.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Myth: </b>&nbsp; 
              My health insurance policy will cover 100% of my hospital bills
              <p><b> Reality </b>
                Every policy has different caps and limits when it comes to claim settlement. Hence, a 
                certain amount of the entire expense is usually provided by the insurance companies at
                every claim settlement. There are certain exclusions in every policy, these uncovered 
                expenses are to be borne by the policyholder.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Myth: </b>&nbsp;
              I do not have to disclose all my medical details.
              <p><b>Reality </b>
                Disclosing all the medical details to the insurer is required in order to confirm that 
                your medical condition falls under the coverage terms of the company. It is also necessary 
                to give proof of expense for making claims. Hiding information can lead to rejection of claims 
                and even legal trouble.

              <b>Myth: </b>&nbsp;
              If I have a health issue, I will not be able to buy health insurance.
              <p><b>Reality </b>
                You can buy special health insurance if you have pre-existing conditions. 
                There are certain health insurance products specially made for people who have 
                some medical issues. However, the effect of your health condition will directly 
                affect the premium to be paid.

            <li>
              <b>Myth: </b>&nbsp;
              A health plan does not cover maternity benefits.
              <p><b> Reality </b>
                Not all health plans cover maternity benefits, so be sure to check the same 
                while investing in a policy. However, most insurances offer that add-on and 
                maternity benefits can be enjoyed only after the completion of the waiting period. 
                There are companies that have especially made health insurance products for women.

              Buying health insurance through an agent is the best way to buy.
              <p><b>Reality </b>
                Nowadays, with so much information available online, it is best to invest in health
                insurance after proper comparison with all the other companies. You can use the premium

											<p class="paragraph-text">Online premium calculators are available for calculating the premiums payable for health insurance plans. These calculators are available both on insurance companies&rsquo; websites and also on insurance aggregators&rsquo; websites. Insurance aggregator websites calculators are better because they let individuals compare the health insurance quotes of different plans at once.</p>
											<p>The calculator works on the input provided by individuals. Individuals have to enter the following details in the calculator to arrive at the health insurance quotes &ndash;</p>
											<ul>
												<li>The number of members to be covered</li>
												<li>The age of all the members who are being covered</li>
												<li>The sum insured which is required</li>
												<li>Any additional coverage benefits which are to be added. Additional coverage benefits, if chosen, would attract an additional premium</li>
												<li>The term of the plan</li>
												<li>If the insured or any other members suffer from any pre-existing illness or not</li>
												<li>Any discounts which are applicable to the premium</li>
											</ul>
											<p>When all the above-mentioned details are put in the calculator, the calculator calculates and lists the health insurance quotes of different medical insurance plans available in the market. Individuals can, then, compare the premium rates and coverage benefits and select a health insurance plan.</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Cashless claims</li>
												<li>Reimbursement claims</li>
											</ul>
											<p>In cashless claims, the insurance company settles the medical bills directly with the hospital. The policyholder does not have to pay for any medical costs himself. Cashless claim settlement can be availed if the policyholder chooses to get admitted to a hospital which is tied-up with the insurance company.</p>
											<p>In the case of reimbursement claims, the medical expenses are to be borne by the policyholder initially. Thereafter, when the insured is discharged from the hospital, the claim is submitted to the insurance company with all the relevant bills and medical documents. The company analyses the claims and then reimburses the policyholder for the medical expenses incurred. Reimbursement claims are applicable if the policyholder does not choose a networked hospital for treatments</p>

											<p class="paragraph-text">Super top-up plans, like top-up plans, have a deductible limit. However, the aggregate claim made in a policy year is considered when the deductible limit is applied. If the aggregate claim exceeds the deductible limit, the claim is paid. For instance, in a super top-up plan of INR 5 lakhs, the deductible is INR 2 lakhs. Now, there are three claims in a policy year of INR 1 lakh, INR 1.5 lakhs and INR 2 lakhs respectively. The first claim would not be paid by the super top-up plan. However, in the second claim, the total claim becomes INR 2.5 lakhs. Since this is higher than the deductible, INR 50, 000 is paid as claim. Similarly, in the third instance, the aggregate claim is INR 4.5 lakhs. The super top-up plan would, therefore, pay INR 2.5 lakhs as a claim.</p>
