							<ol>
								<li><b>Mandatory:</b>Having motor insurance is no longer a choice.

								<li><b>Reduce the cost of damage:</b> Car insurance reduces the cost of damage caused to the vehicle, the policyholder/owner, cost or repair, legal liabilities, loss of life, hospitalization cost, etc. Car insurance policy will come to rescue at times like these.</li>
								<li><b>24*7 assistance:</b> These days most insurance companies provide 24*7 roadside assistance in case of a sudden breakdown</li>
								<li><b>Cashless services:</b> Car insurance also comes with the option of availing cashless services in the certified network garages across the nation.</li>

							<h2 class="SEO-content-heading">Add-ons in a car insurance policy</h2>
							<div class="SEO-content-text">Insurance companies provide add-on covers which are additional covers to protect your car and provide extra coverage with the basic insurance cover. Add-on covers can be taken upon payment of extra premium  which is added to car insurance quotes to get the final premium payable for the policy. Add-on covers are available under <a href="https://tm.stagingtech.in/car-insurance/comprehensive-car-insurance/" target="_blank">comprehensive car insurance</a> policies. Some common add-ons include the following - 
							</div>
							<ol>
								<li><b>No Claim Bonus Protection</b><br>For every claim-free year, the insurance company provides a discount on the premium to be paid upon renewal of the insurance policy. This bonus is cumulative and every year, increases. No Claim Bonus protection cover protects the NCB. No Claim Bonus becomes void on making a claim and this add on the cover helps you in retaining the No Claim Bonus even after making a claim.</li>
								<li><b>Engine Protection Cover </b><br>This cover protects the policyholder and compensates for any damage caused to the engine by leakages or water ingression. This add on cover protects the engine, gearbox and differential parts of the insured vehicle.</li>
								<li><b>Zero depreciation cover</b><br>This add-on cover compensates for the depreciating value of the car. With this cover, the policyholder does not have to pay for the depreciated value of the car. This add-on is subjected to some claims. The feature of voluntary deductible remains applicable even with zero depreciation add-on cover.</li>
								<li><b>Consumable Cover</b><br>This add-on cover compensates for the consumable items like nuts-bolts, grease, lubricants, engine oil, brake oil, etc.</li>
								<li><b>Key protection cover </b><br>This add on covers the policyholder for expenses incurred on key replacement or repair. This is a fixed number claim add-on cover and requires FIR in case of theft. The cover pays for replacing the key and lock in case of both thefts and lost.</li>
								<li><b>Daily allowance </b><br>This cover gives the benefit of daily allowance when the car is at the workshop for repair for more than 3 days. This allowance is given for travelling through any other mode other than the insured vehicle.</li>
								<li><b>Personal Accident Rider </b><br>This rider provides coverage for personal injury, death, disability or damage due to an accident</li>

													<b>Roadside assistance cover</b> 
													<p>Under this additional cover, the policyholder is assured of a round-the-clock assistance provided by the insurance company if the car breaks down in the middle of the road and needs assistance in being transported to the nearest garage. </p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<b>Engine protect cover</b> 
													<p>The engine protect cover covers the damages suffered by the engine of the car due to waterlogging. If the car is submerged in water and the policyholder tries to start the car, water might seep into the engine and damage it. Such damages are covered under the add-on. </p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<b>NCB protect cover</b> 
													<p>If there is no claim in the car insurance policy, the policyholder earns a no claim bonus (NCB). This bonus provides a discount in the renewal premium. However, a single instance of claim wipes out the entire NCB and no discount is allowed in the renewal premium. This add-on protects the NCB even in case of a claim. </p>

													<b>Consumables cover</b>

													<b> Loss of belongings</b> 
													<p>Under this add-on, if personal belongings are lost from the cover, the cost of the loss suffered is covered </p>

												<li>
													<b>Return to Invoice</b> 
													<p>Under this cover, the invoice or full value of the car is paid as claim if the car is stolen or is damaged beyond repairs. A normal policy without the add-on will pay a maximum claim of the insured declared value (IDV) which is calculated after depreciation. </p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<b>Personal accident cover for passengers</b> 
													<p>Under this add-on, personal accident cover is available for unnamed passengers travelling in the car with the owner/driver. A lump sum benefit is paid in case of accidental death and disablements faced by such passengers. </p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<b>Medical Expenses Cover</b> 
													<p>Under this add-on, the medical expenses caused due to an accident towards the owner driver would be covered. </p>

													<b>What is No Claim Bonus?</b> 
													<p>No claim bonus (NCB) is the discount in the premium charged to the policy holder when no claim has been made during the policy term. It keeps increasing from 20% up to 50%, for every claim free year. </p>
													<p>The no claim bonus is 20% for the first claim-free year. Thereafter, it increases every consecutive claim-free year. The available bonus rates are as follows – </p>
