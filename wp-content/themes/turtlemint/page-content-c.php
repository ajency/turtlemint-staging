			<h2 class="adds-heading">7 things to know about life insurance</h2>
			<div class="SEO-content-text">According to Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs, Life Insurance or Protection should be one’s primary importance. Theoretically, everyone knows about it, but rarely do we understand the real importance of the same.</div>
			<div class="SEO-content-text">Life insurance is a safeguard against financial deficiency at the time of insured Individual’s death. Practically, life insurance grants you and your family the financial security. It also provides you assurance to deal with any unforeseen events. Life insurance is preferred according to the needs and goals of the insured. So, buying a life insurance policy is important.</div>
			<div class="SEO-content-text">Read more about <a href="/term-life-insurance/articles/reasons-to-buy-a-life-insurance-now?utm_source=turtlemint-blog&utm_medium=organic-blog&utm_campaign=Term-Life-Blog">Reason to buy life insurance now</a></div>
			<div class="SEO-content-text">However, before you invest in a life insurance plan, here are 7 things that you absolutely need to know -</div>
			<div class="SEO-content-text">
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Insurance is NOT an investment</b><br>This is the first thing you need to acknowledge and accept that insurance should never be considered as an investment. Insurance is a vital part of financial planning. But a lot of people consider it as an investment.<br>
						This is primarily because there are some life insurance plans in India that double up as investments.  For example, Endowment Policies have a lump-sum maturity benefit, Money Back Plans have regular payments during the entire policy tenure as pre-defined schedule and Unit Linked Insurance Plans have an opportunity to choose your investments even in equity! But what you need to keep in mind while choosing your Life Insurance Policy is the coverage amount you wish to purchase for your family. Insurance is synonymous to protection and that is the primary and most important objective of ANY life insurance product. They should not be evaluated on the basis of their return, bonus, etc.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Required Coverage amount</b><br>The required coverage amount for your insurance policy is the most important aspect of choosing a plan. It depends on your lifestyle and priorities. You have to consider your standard of living, inflation, needs, liabilities etc. Then, accordingly, decide your coverage amount which would be sufficient for your family.<br>
						For instance, if your family’s monthly expenses are say ₹50,000. You need to opt for a Life Insurance coverage of at least ₹ 1 crore so that a post-tax interest earning is enough to provide for the family’s regular monthly expenses! So, ensure that your coverage amount is sufficient to meet the monthly expense of your family in your absence.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Policy Tenure</b><br>The tenure of Life insurance policies depends on the type of plan you opt for. You can choose any tenure that you think is necessary for you and your family. However, the best way to select an apt tenure for your insurance policy is as long as you are earning and providing for your family. This is typically till the age of 60 or 65 years post which your children will definitely start earning and so your financial dependence will gradually reduce!
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Type of Life Insurance best suited for you</b></br>There are varieties of plans offered and available in the market. It all depends on your needs as to which plan you opt for. Some of the insurance plans are:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Term Insurance</li>
							<li>Whole life insurance plans</li>
							<li>Endowment Assurance Plans</li>
							<li>Money-Back Plans</li>
							<li>Child Plans</li>
							<li>Pension Plans</li>
							<li>Unit Linked Insurance Plan</li>
						</ol>
						Out of the above-stated plans, <a href="https://www.turtlemint.com/term-life-insurance?utm_source=turtlemint-blog&utm_medium=organic-blog&utm_campaign=Term-Life-Blog">Term Plan</a> is the basic and the purest form of life Insurance. It is the cheapest plan. This plan covers only the death risk and has no maturity benefit. The payment is made in lump-sum amount if the insured person dies during the tenure of the plan.<br>
						Read more about <a href="https://www.turtlemint.com/term-life-insurance/articles/why-is-term-insurance-an-absolute-buy?utm_source=turtlemint-blog&utm_medium=organic-blog&utm_campaign=Term-Life-Blog">Why is term insurance is an absolute buy</a><br>
						So, if you need a high coverage at a low cost, term plan is the best choice!
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Claim Procedure:</b><br>You and your nominee should be completely aware of the claim procedure so as to expedite the claim as and when the requirement occurs.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Benefit Offered: Death and Maturity Benefit</b><br>There are two types of benefits in life insurance plans.
						<ol type="a">
							<li>One is Death Benefit, where the beneficiaries will receive a lump-sum amount if the life insured dies within the policy tenure.</li>
							<li>The other one is Maturity Benefit, where the claim arises when the policy is matured. It is paid only when all premiums are paid on time.</li>
						</ol>
						Maturity Benefit is payable to all life insurance policies except term plans. Endowment Plans are a type of Life Insurance with maturity benefit. Even ULIPs have maturity benefits. These kinds of policies are relatively quite expensive compared to term insurance, but it protects your family with a coverage amount in case the insured dies within the policy tenure. Alongside, these policies have a maturity benefit payable to the policyholder, if you happen to outlive the entire tenure. Hence, the money is not completely foregone in case you survive past the policy term; as is the case with term plans!
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Tax Advantages</b><br>Life Insurance plans, apart from providing funds, also save taxes. Under <a href="https://cleartax.in/s/80c-80-deductions">Section 80C</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Income-tax_Act,_1961">Income Tax Act, 1961</a>, premium amount contributed to life insurance plans are eligible for tax rebate. The limit for premium contribution is up to ₹1,50,000. Also, under <a href="http://profit.ndtv.com/news/your-money/article-how-to-avail-tax-benefits-under-section-10-377826">Section 10(10D)</a> of Income Tax Act, 1961, amount of sum insured paid on maturity or death or surrender of policy is completely tax-free. So, life insurance is preferred by many as it protects your family and is also tax efficient.
					</li>
				</ol>
				Know these important aspects of life insurance and then choose the right plan.

										In comparison to investment-type life insurance plans, term life plans only get you a death benefit and not any other return. However, the death benefits you get is substantial in comparison, typically 500-1000 times your annual premium. It would take an investment earning 10% interest for more than 65 years – a lifetime - to get a 500X return!

									<p class="paragraph-text paragraph-style">
										Term insurance is also quite cheap, e.g. for a 30-year-old, a cover of 50 lakhs, costs about Rs. 4,000 per year.

										Investment policies: Investment-type life insurance plan pays your family a certain sum of money as maturity returns after a set time period (called policy term) or the death benefit in event of your death (while the policy is in force); in exchange of a premium.

									<p class="paragraph-text ">The rule of thumb is that you should buy a life cover of at least 10 times, and ideally 20 times your annual salary, so that your family can continue to have similar quality of life even after the breadwinner dies.
									</p>
									<p class="paragraph-text paragraph-style">
                                    Why would you need so much cover? Consider a simple scenario, where Anil, who’s salary is 5 lakhs, took the recommended minimum cover of 10 times salary, i.e. 50 lakhs. On his death, his family puts the 50 lakhs of payout corpus in a fixed deposit. With interest of 8% this would give 4 lakhs of substitute income for his family, to manage their day-to-day expenses. It’s less than before but should be fine since Anil’s expenses are no longer to be borne. Now if Anil had loans to pay or other unplanned costs come up, then the corpus will reduce and so will the interest income. Also with effect of inflation the interest income may not be enough as years pass by. So, to be fully safe ideal cover would be 20 times the salary.

Insurance companies are able to offer you a cover several times the premium you paid simply because not everyone in the pool falls sick in the same year!
